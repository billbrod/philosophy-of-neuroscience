# Neuroscience needs behavior: correcting a reductionist bias
# Krakauer, Poeppel
- No prior knowledge on what the relevant level of brain organization is for any given behavior
# Degeneracy
- Same behavior can result from altenative circuit configuration
From diff circuits
- Same circuit can generate many diff behaviours
# Software vs hardware — distinction between processors and processes they implement
- Substrate independence?
- “Are the processes governing behaviour best inferred from examination of the processors”
- Processor’s operations can be drawn in algorithmic flow chart; but performing interventionist neuroscience on the processor could not explain how the processor worked
# Connectomics
- We know everything about C elegans but how structure —> behaviour is surprisingly incomplete
- Even more low-level connections? Is the neuron as unit not enough? Ex RIA
# Substitution bias
- We are subbing in an easier question for a more difficult quesiton
- What is true of circuit is not necessarily true for behaviour
Hypothesis-based behavioral experiments
- Behaviour not as a hasty add-on
- Behaviour as a stand-alone/ foundational phenomenon in its own right
Definition of Behaviour:
- “TInbergen: The total movements made by the intact animal”
- “Internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as deveopmental changes”
- VR
Ecological validity?
- Is a behaviour something that exists in the real world? A social behaviour? etc.
VR — an antidote for non-ethological lab experiments?
Effective use of VR requires a fine-grained quantitative understanding of the behaviour under study as it occurs in unimpeded animal
Marr
Description is NOT understanding
*** HOW SO?
“causal efficacy is too often taken as understanding”
Need a better a priori testable framework for behavioural-level understanding that can lead to more thoughtfully designed neurophysiological experiments
Intentional Stance — Dennett, 1989
“When an entity is designed for a purpose it is therefore subject to rational rules that can be determined by studying its behaviour without necessarily having to analyze all its physical parts”
Kording’s microprocessor paper
No conceptual structure in place bc no behavioural-level hypothesis is being tested
Mechanism
Definition of mechanism: “a structure performing a function in virtue of its component parts, component operations, and their organization”
Causality
Ion channels and hearts; rhythm just IS the combination of higher level of cell membrane and lower level of ion channels
Ion channels don’t CAUSE the cardiac rhythm
“Every scientist takes a philosophical position, either tacitly or explicitly, whenever they state that a result is ‘ipmortant’, ‘fundamental’, or ‘interesting.’”
Such assertions are always a judgment from the outside of science
Normative claims and abstract reasoning cannot be obtained from data
Case studies: Behaviourally-driven neuroscience yields more complete insights
Bradykinesia; observation of PD symptoms
Sound localization: inter-aural tiem difference cues
Computing the delay which enables a temporal activation pattern, etc. Jeffress model
Extensive recordings and anatomical study would not have yielded this understanding without an underlying behaviourally-motivated computational theory
AND EMBODIMENT
Electrolocation — sensory input through motor output using jamming avoidance response — JAR
Electric fish discharge oscillating electric field at the same frequency — modify discharge frequenies to avoid jamming
Also embodiment
Motor learning:  obviously embodied
Often studied using adaptation paradigms; participatns subejct to external perturbation, causes systemic errors that have to be corrected
Mechanism of error-based learning could be reverse-engineered from examination at circuit level
But now we know many distinct learning alrogithms operate together to counter effects of perturbation during adaptation
Multiple realizability — long-standing basis for objection to reductionism
Many ways to neurally generate the same behaviour
Properties of a single circuit at a particular instantiation do not reveal a general design principle
Lower levels of explanation do not “explain away” higher levels
Explanations and results at neural level are almost entirely dependent on high-level vocabulary and concepts derived from behavioural work
Experiments at neural level are best designed w hypotheses based on pre-existing behavioral work
Contentions
Causal-manipulation view by itself will not lead to understanding
Pluralism
Pluralistic conceptions of mechanistic understanding can only help neuroscience
Pluralism in science = “the doctrine advocating the cultivation of multiple systems of practice in any given field of science”
Diversity of thought and “cosmopolitanism”
Initial thoughts:
Not a very insightful paper — all of this stuff seems incredibly self-evident to me
Larger debate of embodiment as a whole
The idea of the brain and nervous system as the locus of computation will be contended in the future
I want to talk about substrate independence and how embodied and enactive cognition can challenge these lines of thinking
