# First official meeting

This was the first official meeting of the journal club, where we
discussed the first chapter from David Deutsch's *The Beginning of
Infinity* and a podcast with a talk from Evan Thompson. Deutsch's
chapter largely dealt with what makes a good explanation, while
Thompson's talk examined science from a broader perspective.

## Topics for future discussions

1. Observations vs. Experimental science
   - with the rise of big data, there are people who think we no
     longer need experimental science, that we can just gather a bunch
     of data in a hypothesis-free way and distill facts from them
   - see:
     [The end of theory](https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/),
     [Paul Glimcher's Human Project](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/nyregion/human-project-new-york-city-study.html?_r=0),
     [Tony Movshon and Sebastian Seung's connectomics debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4KrhDZQ088),
     the current vogue for gathering huge data sets in neuroscience,
2. Importance of behavior / ecological validity, especially in
   contrast with controllability

      M. A., & Poeppel, D. (2017). Neuroscience needs behavior:

    - how relevant for vision?
    - see the fMRI experiments from Uri Hasson's lab or Jack Gallant's
      lab that involve passive viewing / listening to movies / natural
      stories vs. classical carefully controlled psychophysics

3. Objectivity in science. Is it possible?
4. What's the goal of (neuro)science?
5. What defines a good / useful model / explanation?
6. Neurocentrism, the valuing of "brain evidence" (however you define
   that) above all else.
   
## David Deutsch: good explanation

- a good explanation should be hard to vary
    - we're not entirely sure how to map this onto computational
      models (does this relate to the parmaeters at all? the
      predictions?)
    - Frankenstein models (like the SOP, Sometimes Opponent Process,
      Model) fail this, because they simply accrue parts to explain
      phenomena that could be considered falsifying
    - a push for simplicity / elegance?
- Theories precede data
    - and allow manipulation? but we haven't prodded stars, so clearly
      this doesn't always need to be the case
    - however, some data can generate new theories, so what's the
      relation between the old ones (used to gather the data) and the
      new ones (spawned by the data)?
- How do good explanations relate to Marr's levels?
    - does a good explanation need to cover multiple levels?
    - is it sufficient, in neuroscience / psychology, to have a model
      that just does a good job predicting behavior, even if it's
      supposed mechanisms don't match up any neural data.
    - but at some point we have to stop: even if we care about neurons
      and biophysical plausibility, we don't want neuroscience models
      that deal with atoms, so what's the point at which we say, "this
      is enough"? 
        - how do we feel about the drift-diffusion model if
          populations of LIP neurons aren't ramping up to a threshold?
            - Katz, L. N., Yates, J. L., Pillow, J. W., & Huk,
              A. C. (2016). Dissociated functional significance of
              decision-related activity in the primate dorsal
              stream. Nature,
              (). http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature18617
		- does the fact that people claim that normalization is a
          canonical computation, but that it has many implementations
          (and we still don't know how it's implemented in many brain
          areas) a strength or a weakness?
            - Carandini, M., & Heeger, D. J. (2011). Normalization as
              a canonical neural computation. Nature Reviews
              Neuroscience, (), . http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn3136
    - some phenomena are probably better understood without bringing
      brains into them (e.g., parenting, racism), since they're
      primarily social in nature

## Evan Thompson

- Western science based on objectifying nature, i.e., viewing it as
  something apart from us that we can manipulate and control
- Mindfulness is a potential antidote to this, but co-opting it into
  existing system cheapens (? weakens) it
    - see
      [interview with Google's chief mindfulness guy](http://religiondispatches.org/rich-people-need-inner-peace-too-an-interview-with-googles-jolly-good-fellow-chade-meng-tan/)
- We can't escape our own experience, but we can create public objects
  of consensus (but there's still a limit because we're all humans)
- We should be aware of our place as actors in the lifeworld, *not*
  separate from it.
- You should be ethically beholden to consequences of your work.
- We are "a source of nature's self-understanding"
    - similar to Carl
      Sagan's
      ["we are a way for the Cosmos to know itself"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLigBYhdUDs)
